        "title": "working-tree-encoding",
        "documentation": "Git recognizes files encoded in ASCII or one of its supersets (e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, …​) as text files. Files encoded in certain other encodings (e.g. UTF-16) are interpreted as binary and consequently built-in Git text processing tools (e.g. _git diff_) as well as most Git web front ends do not visualize the contents of these files by default.\n\nIn these cases you can tell Git the encoding of a file in the working directory with the `working-tree-encoding` attribute. If a file with this attribute is added to Git, then Git re-encodes the content from the specified encoding to UTF-8. Finally, Git stores the UTF-8 encoded content in its internal data structure (called \"the index\"). On checkout the content is re-encoded back to the specified encoding.\n\nPlease note that using the `working-tree-encoding` attribute may have a number of pitfalls:\n\n*   Alternative Git implementations (e.g. JGit or libgit2) and older Git versions (as of March 2018) do not support the `working-tree-encoding` attribute. If you decide to use the `working-tree-encoding` attribute in your repository, then it is strongly recommended to ensure that all clients working with the repository support it.\n    \n    For example, Microsoft Visual Studio resources files (`*.rc`) or PowerShell script files (`*.ps1`) are sometimes encoded in UTF-16. If you declare `*.ps1` as files as UTF-16 and you add `foo.ps1` with a `working-tree-encoding` enabled Git client, then `foo.ps1` will be stored as UTF-8 internally. A client without `working-tree-encoding` support will checkout `foo.ps1` as UTF-8 encoded file. This will typically cause trouble for the users of this file.\n    \n    If a Git client that does not support the `working-tree-encoding` attribute adds a new file `bar.ps1`, then `bar.ps1` will be stored \"as-is\" internally (in this example probably as UTF-16). A client with `working-tree-encoding` support will interpret the internal contents as UTF-8 and try to convert it to UTF-16 on checkout. That operation will fail and cause an error.\n    \n*   Reencoding content to non-UTF encodings can cause errors as the conversion might not be UTF-8 round trip safe. If you suspect your encoding to not be round trip safe, then add it to `core.checkRoundtripEncoding` to make Git check the round trip encoding (see [git-config\\[1\\]](/docs/git-config)). SHIFT-JIS (Japanese character set) is known to have round trip issues with UTF-8 and is checked by default.\n    \n*   Reencoding content requires resources that might slow down certain Git operations (e.g _git checkout_ or _git add_).\n    \n\nUse the `working-tree-encoding` attribute only if you cannot store a file in UTF-8 encoding and if you want Git to be able to process the content as text.\n\nAs an example, use the following attributes if your _\\*.ps1_ files are UTF-16 encoded with byte order mark (BOM) and you want Git to perform automatic line ending conversion based on your platform.\n\n\\*.ps1\t\ttext working-tree-encoding=UTF-16\n\nUse the following attributes if your _\\*.ps1_ files are UTF-16 little endian encoded without BOM and you want Git to use Windows line endings in the working directory (use `UTF-16LE-BOM` instead of `UTF-16LE` if you want UTF-16 little endian with BOM). Please note, it is highly recommended to explicitly define the line endings with `eol` if the `working-tree-encoding` attribute is used to avoid ambiguity.\n\n\\*.ps1\t\ttext working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE eol=CRLF\n\nYou can get a list of all available encodings on your platform with the following command:\n\niconv --list\n\nIf you do not know the encoding of a file, then you can use the `file` command to guess the encoding:\n\nfile foo.ps1"

        "title": "filter",
        "documentation": "A `filter` attribute can be set to a string value that names a filter driver specified in the configuration.\n\nA filter driver consists of a `clean` command and a `smudge` command, either of which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the `smudge` command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the `clean` command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin. By default these commands process only a single blob and terminate. If a long running `process` filter is used in place of `clean` and/or `smudge` filters, then Git can process all blobs with a single filter command invocation for the entire life of a single Git command, for example `git add --all`. If a long running `process` filter is configured then it always takes precedence over a configured single blob filter. See section below for the description of the protocol used to communicate with a `process` filter.\n\nOne use of the content filtering is to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use. For this mode of operation, the key phrase here is \"more convenient\" and not \"turning something unusable into usable\". In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.\n\nAnother use of the content filtering is to store the content that cannot be directly used in the repository (e.g. a UUID that refers to the true content stored outside Git, or an encrypted content) and turn it into a usable form upon checkout (e.g. download the external content, or decrypt the encrypted content).\n\nThese two filters behave differently, and by default, a filter is taken as the former, massaging the contents into more convenient shape. A missing filter driver definition in the config, or a filter driver that exits with a non-zero status, is not an error but makes the filter a no-op passthru.\n\nYou can declare that a filter turns a content that by itself is unusable into a usable content by setting the filter.<driver>.required configuration variable to `true`.\n\nNote: Whenever the clean filter is changed, the repo should be renormalized: $ git add --renormalize .\n\nFor example, in .gitattributes, you would assign the `filter` attribute for paths.\n\n\\*.c\tfilter=indent\n\nThen you would define a \"filter.indent.clean\" and \"filter.indent.smudge\" configuration in your .git/config to specify a pair of commands to modify the contents of C programs when the source files are checked in (\"clean\" is run) and checked out (no change is made because the command is \"cat\").\n\n\\[filter \"indent\"\\]\n\tclean = indent\n\tsmudge = cat\n\nFor best results, `clean` should not alter its output further if it is run twice (\"clean→clean\" should be equivalent to \"clean\"), and multiple `smudge` commands should not alter `clean`'s output (\"smudge→smudge→clean\" should be equivalent to \"clean\"). See the section on merging below.\n\nThe \"indent\" filter is well-behaved in this regard: it will not modify input that is already correctly indented. In this case, the lack of a smudge filter means that the clean filter _must_ accept its own output without modifying it.\n\nIf a filter _must_ succeed in order to make the stored contents usable, you can declare that the filter is `required`, in the configuration:\n\n\\[filter \"crypt\"\\]\n\tclean = openssl enc ...\n\tsmudge = openssl enc -d ...\n\trequired\n\nSequence \"%f\" on the filter command line is replaced with the name of the file the filter is working on. A filter might use this in keyword substitution. For example:\n\n\\[filter \"p4\"\\]\n\tclean = git-p4-filter --clean %f\n\tsmudge = git-p4-filter --smudge %f\n\nNote that \"%f\" is the name of the path that is being worked on. Depending on the version that is being filtered, the corresponding file on disk may not exist, or may have different contents. So, smudge and clean commands should not try to access the file on disk, but only act as filters on the content provided to them on standard input.\n\n#### [](#_long_running_filter_process)Long Running Filter Process\n\nIf the filter command (a string value) is defined via `filter.<driver>.process` then Git can process all blobs with a single filter invocation for the entire life of a single Git command. This is achieved by using the long-running process protocol (described in technical/long-running-process-protocol.txt).\n\nWhen Git encounters the first file that needs to be cleaned or smudged, it starts the filter and performs the handshake. In the handshake, the welcome message sent by Git is \"git-filter-client\", only version 2 is supported, and the supported capabilities are \"clean\", \"smudge\", and \"delay\".\n\nAfterwards Git sends a list of \"key=value\" pairs terminated with a flush packet. The list will contain at least the filter command (based on the supported capabilities) and the pathname of the file to filter relative to the repository root. Right after the flush packet Git sends the content split in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet to terminate content. Please note, that the filter must not send any response before it received the content and the final flush packet. Also note that the \"value\" of a \"key=value\" pair can contain the \"=\" character whereas the key would never contain that character.\n\npacket:          git> command=smudge\npacket:          git> pathname=path/testfile.dat\npacket:          git> 0000\npacket:          git> CONTENT\npacket:          git> 0000\n\nThe filter is expected to respond with a list of \"key=value\" pairs terminated with a flush packet. If the filter does not experience problems then the list must contain a \"success\" status. Right after these packets the filter is expected to send the content in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet at the end. Finally, a second list of \"key=value\" pairs terminated with a flush packet is expected. The filter can change the status in the second list or keep the status as is with an empty list. Please note that the empty list must be terminated with a flush packet regardless.\n\npacket:          git< status=success\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< SMUDGED\\_CONTENT\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< 0000  # empty list, keep \"status=success\" unchanged!\n\nIf the result content is empty then the filter is expected to respond with a \"success\" status and a flush packet to signal the empty content.\n\npacket:          git< status=success\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< 0000  # empty content!\npacket:          git< 0000  # empty list, keep \"status=success\" unchanged!\n\nIn case the filter cannot or does not want to process the content, it is expected to respond with an \"error\" status.\n\npacket:          git< status=error\npacket:          git< 0000\n\nIf the filter experiences an error during processing, then it can send the status \"error\" after the content was (partially or completely) sent.\n\npacket:          git< status=success\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< HALF\\_WRITTEN\\_ERRONEOUS\\_CONTENT\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< status=error\npacket:          git< 0000\n\nIn case the filter cannot or does not want to process the content as well as any future content for the lifetime of the Git process, then it is expected to respond with an \"abort\" status at any point in the protocol.\n\npacket:          git< status=abort\npacket:          git< 0000\n\nGit neither stops nor restarts the filter process in case the \"error\"/\"abort\" status is set. However, Git sets its exit code according to the `filter.<driver>.required` flag, mimicking the behavior of the `filter.<driver>.clean` / `filter.<driver>.smudge` mechanism.\n\nIf the filter dies during the communication or does not adhere to the protocol then Git will stop the filter process and restart it with the next file that needs to be processed. Depending on the `filter.<driver>.required` flag Git will interpret that as error.\n\n#### [](#_delay)Delay\n\nIf the filter supports the \"delay\" capability, then Git can send the flag \"can-delay\" after the filter command and pathname. This flag denotes that the filter can delay filtering the current blob (e.g. to compensate network latencies) by responding with no content but with the status \"delayed\" and a flush packet.\n\npacket:          git> command=smudge\npacket:          git> pathname=path/testfile.dat\npacket:          git> can-delay=1\npacket:          git> 0000\npacket:          git> CONTENT\npacket:          git> 0000\npacket:          git< status=delayed\npacket:          git< 0000\n\nIf the filter supports the \"delay\" capability then it must support the \"list\\_available\\_blobs\" command. If Git sends this command, then the filter is expected to return a list of pathnames representing blobs that have been delayed earlier and are now available. The list must be terminated with a flush packet followed by a \"success\" status that is also terminated with a flush packet. If no blobs for the delayed paths are available, yet, then the filter is expected to block the response until at least one blob becomes available. The filter can tell Git that it has no more delayed blobs by sending an empty list. As soon as the filter responds with an empty list, Git stops asking. All blobs that Git has not received at this point are considered missing and will result in an error.\n\npacket:          git> command=list\\_available\\_blobs\npacket:          git> 0000\npacket:          git< pathname=path/testfile.dat\npacket:          git< pathname=path/otherfile.dat\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< status=success\npacket:          git< 0000\n\nAfter Git received the pathnames, it will request the corresponding blobs again. These requests contain a pathname and an empty content section. The filter is expected to respond with the smudged content in the usual way as explained above.\n\npacket:          git> command=smudge\npacket:          git> pathname=path/testfile.dat\npacket:          git> 0000\npacket:          git> 0000  # empty content!\npacket:          git< status=success\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< SMUDGED\\_CONTENT\npacket:          git< 0000\npacket:          git< 0000  # empty list, keep \"status=success\" unchanged!\n\n#### [](#_example)Example\n\nA long running filter demo implementation can be found in `contrib/long-running-filter/example.pl` located in the Git core repository. If you develop your own long running filter process then the `GIT_TRACE_PACKET` environment variables can be very helpful for debugging (see [git\\[1\\]](/docs/git)).\n\nPlease note that you cannot use an existing `filter.<driver>.clean` or `filter.<driver>.smudge` command with `filter.<driver>.process` because the former two use a different inter process communication protocol than the latter one.\n\n#### [](#_interaction_between_checkincheckout_attributes)Interaction between checkin/checkout attributes\n\nIn the check-in codepath, the worktree file is first converted with `filter` driver (if specified and corresponding driver defined), then the result is processed with `ident` (if specified), and then finally with `text` (again, if specified and applicable).\n\nIn the check-out codepath, the blob content is first converted with `text`, and then `ident` and fed to `filter`.\n\n#### [](#_merging_branches_with_differing_checkincheckout_attributes)Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes\n\nIf you have added attributes to a file that cause the canonical repository format for that file to change, such as adding a clean/smudge filter or text/eol/ident attributes, merging anything where the attribute is not in place would normally cause merge conflicts.\n\nTo prevent these unnecessary merge conflicts, Git can be told to run a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge by setting the `merge.renormalize` configuration variable. This prevents changes caused by check-in conversion from causing spurious merge conflicts when a converted file is merged with an unconverted file.\n\nAs long as a \"smudge→clean\" results in the same output as a \"clean\" even on files that are already smudged, this strategy will automatically resolve all filter-related conflicts. Filters that do not act in this way may cause additional merge conflicts that must be resolved manually."

However…​\n\nTo define an external diff driver `jcdiff`, add a section to your `$GIT_DIR/config` file (or `$HOME/.gitconfig` file) like this:\n\n\\[diff \"jcdiff\"\\]\n\tcommand = j-c-diff\n\nWhen Git needs to show you a diff for the path with `diff` attribute set to `jcdiff`, it calls the command you specified with the above configuration, i.e. `j-c-diff`, with 7 parameters, just like `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` program is called. See [git\\[1\\]](/docs/git) for details.\n\n#### [](#_setting_the_internal_diff_algorithm)Setting the internal diff algorithm\n\nThe diff algorithm can be set through the `diff.algorithm` config key, but sometimes it may be helpful to set the diff algorithm per path. For example, one may want to use the `minimal` diff algorithm for .json files, and the `histogram` for .c files, and so on without having to pass in the algorithm through the command line each time.\n\nFirst, in `.gitattributes`, assign the `diff` attribute for paths.\n\n\\*.json diff=<name>\n\nThen, define a \"diff.<name>.algorithm\" configuration to specify the diff algorithm, choosing from `myers`, `patience`, `minimal`, or `histogram`.\n\n\\[diff \"<name>\"\\]\n  algorithm = histogram\n\nThis diff algorithm applies to user facing diff output like git-diff(1), git-show(1) and is used for the `--stat` output as well. The merge machinery will not use the diff algorithm set through this method.\n\nNote\n\nIf `diff.<name>.command` is defined for path with the `diff=<name>` attribute, it is executed as an external diff driver (see above), and adding `diff.<name>.algorithm` has no effect, as the algorithm is not passed to the external diff driver.\n\n#### [](#_defining_a_custom_hunk_header)Defining a custom hunk-header\n\nEach group of changes (called a \"hunk\") in the textual diff output is prefixed with a line of the form:\n\n@@ -k,l +n,m @@ TEXT\n\nThis is called a _hunk header_. The \"TEXT\" portion is by default a line that begins with an alphabet, an underscore or a dollar sign; this matches what GNU _diff -p_ output uses. This default selection however is not suited for some contents, and you can use a customized pattern to make a selection.\n\nFirst, in .gitattributes, you would assign the `diff` attribute for paths.\n\n\\*.tex\tdiff=tex\n\nThen, you would define a \"diff.tex.xfuncname\" configuration to specify a regular expression that matches a line that you would want to appear as the hunk header \"TEXT\". Add a section to your `$GIT_DIR/config` file (or `$HOME/.gitconfig` file) like this:\n\n\\[diff \"tex\"\\]\n\txfuncname = \"^(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(sub)\\*section\\\\\\\\{.\\*)$\"\n\nNote. A single level of backslashes are eaten by the configuration file parser, so you would need to double the backslashes; the pattern above picks a line that begins with a backslash, and zero or more occurrences of `sub` followed by `section` followed by open brace, to the end of line.\n\nThere are a few built-in patterns to make this easier, and `tex` is one of them, so you do not have to write the above in your configuration file (you still need to enable this with the attribute mechanism, via `.gitattributes`). The following built in patterns are available:\n\n*   `ada` suitable for source code in the Ada language.\n    \n*   `bash` suitable for source code in the Bourne-Again SHell language. Covers a superset of POSIX shell function definitions.\n    \n*   `bibtex` suitable for files with BibTeX coded references.\n    \n*   `cpp` suitable for source code in the C and C++ languages.\n    \n*   `csharp` suitable for source code in the C# language.\n    \n*   `css` suitable for cascading style sheets.\n    \n*   `dts` suitable for devicetree (DTS) files.\n    \n*   `elixir` suitable for source code in the Elixir language.\n    \n*   `fortran` suitable for source code in the Fortran language.\n    \n*   `fountain` suitable for Fountain documents.\n    \n*   `golang` suitable for source code in the Go language.\n    \n*   `html` suitable for HTML/XHTML documents.\n    \n*   `java` suitable for source code in the Java language.\n    \n*   `kotlin` suitable for source code in the Kotlin language.\n    \n*   `markdown` suitable for Markdown documents.\n    \n*   `matlab` suitable for source code in the MATLAB and Octave languages.\n    \n*   `objc` suitable for source code in the Objective-C language.\n    \n*   `pascal` suitable for source code in the Pascal/Delphi language.\n    \n*   `perl` suitable for source code in the Perl language.\n    \n*   `php` suitable for source code in the PHP language.\n    \n*   `python` suitable for source code in the Python language.\n    \n*   `ruby` suitable for source code in the Ruby language.\n    \n*   `rust` suitable for source code in the Rust language.\n    \n*   `scheme` suitable for source code in the Scheme language.\n    \n*   `tex` suitable for source code for LaTeX documents.\n\n#### [](#_customizing_word_diff)Customizing word diff\n\nYou can customize the rules that `git diff --word-diff` uses to split words in a line, by specifying an appropriate regular expression in the \"diff.\\*.wordRegex\" configuration variable. For example, in TeX a backslash followed by a sequence of letters forms a command, but several such commands can be run together without intervening whitespace. To separate them, use a regular expression in your `$GIT_DIR/config` file (or `$HOME/.gitconfig` file) like this:\n\n\\[diff \"tex\"\\]\n\twordRegex = \"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[a-zA-Z\\]+|\\[{}\\]|\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.|\\[^\\\\\\\\{}\\[:space:\\]\\]+\"\n\nA built-in pattern is provided for all languages listed in the previous section.\n\n#### [](#_performing_text_diffs_of_binary_files)Performing text diffs of binary files\n\nSometimes it is desirable to see the diff of a text-converted version of some binary files. For example, a word processor document can be converted to an ASCII text representation, and the diff of the text shown. Even though this conversion loses some information, the resulting diff is useful for human viewing (but cannot be applied directly).\n\nThe `textconv` config option is used to define a program for performing such a conversion. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout.\n\nFor example, to show the diff of the exif information of a file instead of the binary information (assuming you have the exif tool installed), add the following section to your `$GIT_DIR/config` file (or `$HOME/.gitconfig` file):\n\n\\[diff \"jpg\"\\]\n\ttextconv = exif\n\nNote\n\nThe text conversion is generally a one-way conversion; in this example, we lose the actual image contents and focus just on the text data. This means that diffs generated by textconv are _not_ suitable for applying. For this reason, only `git diff` and the `git log` family of commands (i.e., log, whatchanged, show) will perform text conversion. `git format-patch` will never generate this output. If you want to send somebody a text-converted diff of a binary file (e.g., because it quickly conveys the changes you have made), you should generate it separately and send it as a comment _in addition to_ the usual binary diff that you might send.\n\nBecause text conversion can be slow, especially when doing a large number of them with `git log -p`, Git provides a mechanism to cache the output and use it in future diffs. To enable caching, set the \"cachetextconv\" variable in your diff driver’s config. For example:\n\n\\[diff \"jpg\"\\]\n\ttextconv = exif\n\tcachetextconv = true\n\nThis will cache the result of running \"exif\" on each blob indefinitely. If you change the textconv config variable for a diff driver, Git will automatically invalidate the cache entries and re-run the textconv filter. If you want to invalidate the cache manually (e.g., because your version of \"exif\" was updated and now produces better output), you can remove the cache manually with `git update-ref -d refs/notes/textconv/jpg` (where \"jpg\" is the name of the diff driver, as in the example above).\n\n#### [](#_choosing_textconv_versus_external_diff)Choosing textconv versus external diff\n\nIf you want to show differences between binary or specially-formatted blobs in your repository, you can choose to use either an external diff command, or to use textconv to convert them to a diff-able text format. Which method you choose depends on your exact situation.\n\nThe advantage of using an external diff command is flexibility. You are not bound to find line-oriented changes, nor is it necessary for the output to resemble unified diff. You are free to locate and report changes in the most appropriate way for your data format.\n\nA textconv, by comparison, is much more limiting. You provide a transformation of the data into a line-oriented text format, and Git uses its regular diff tools to generate the output. There are several advantages to choosing this method:\n\n1.  Ease of use. It is often much simpler to write a binary to text transformation than it is to perform your own diff. In many cases, existing programs can be used as textconv filters (e.g., exif, odt2txt).\n    \n2.  Git diff features. By performing only the transformation step yourself, you can still utilize many of Git’s diff features, including colorization, word-diff, and combined diffs for merges.\n    \n3.  Caching. Textconv caching can speed up repeated diffs, such as those you might trigger by running `git log -p`.\n\n#### [](#_marking_files_as_binary)Marking files as binary\n\nGit usually guesses correctly whether a blob contains text or binary data by examining the beginning of the contents. However, sometimes you may want to override its decision, either because a blob contains binary data later in the file, or because the content, while technically composed of text characters, is opaque to a human reader. For example, many postscript files contain only ASCII characters, but produce noisy and meaningless diffs.\n\nThe simplest way to mark a file as binary is to unset the diff attribute in the `.gitattributes` file:\n\n\\*.ps -diff\n\nThis will cause Git to generate `Binary files differ` (or a binary patch, if binary patches are enabled) instead of a regular diff.\n\nHowever, one may also want to specify other diff driver attributes. For example, you might want to use `textconv` to convert postscript files to an ASCII representation for human viewing, but otherwise treat them as binary files. You cannot specify both `-diff` and `diff=ps` attributes. The solution is to use the `diff.*.binary` config option:\n\n\\[diff \"ps\"\\]\n  textconv = ps2ascii\n  binary = true"

However…​\n\nTo define a custom merge driver `filfre`, add a section to your `$GIT_DIR/config` file (or `$HOME/.gitconfig` file) like this:\n\n\\[merge \"filfre\"\\]\n\tname = feel-free merge driver\n\tdriver = filfre %O %A %B %L %P\n\trecursive = binary\n\nThe `merge.*.name` variable gives the driver a human-readable name.\n\nThe `merge.*.driver` variable’s value is used to construct a command to run to merge ancestor’s version (`%O`), current version (`%A`) and the other branches' version (`%B`). These three tokens are replaced with the names of temporary files that hold the contents of these versions when the command line is built. Additionally, %L will be replaced with the conflict marker size (see below).\n\nThe merge driver is expected to leave the result of the merge in the file named with `%A` by overwriting it, and exit with zero status if it managed to merge them cleanly, or non-zero if there were conflicts. When the driver crashes (e.g. killed by SEGV), it is expected to exit with non-zero status that are higher than 128, and in such a case, the merge results in a failure (which is different from producing a conflict).\n\nThe `merge.*.recursive` variable specifies what other merge driver to use when the merge driver is called for an internal merge between common ancestors, when there are more than one. When left unspecified, the driver itself is used for both internal merge and the final merge.\n\nThe merge driver can learn the pathname in which the merged result will be stored via placeholder `%P`."
