The variable can be set to \"warn\", in which case Git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the operation.\n\nCRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data. When it is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during checkout. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated by Git. For text files this is the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings in the repository. But for binary files that are accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt data.\n\nIf you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by setting the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes. Right after committing you still have the original file in your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git will handle the file appropriately.\n\nUnfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data.\n\nNote, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate a file identical to the original file for a different setting of `core.eol` and `core.autocrlf`, but only for the current one. For example, a text file with `LF` would be accepted with `core.eol=lf` and could later be checked out with `core.eol=crlf`, in which case the resulting file would contain `CRLF`, although the original file contained `LF`. However, in both work trees the line endings would be consistent, that is either all `LF` or all `CRLF`, but never mixed. A file with mixed line endings would be reported by the `core.safecrlf` mechanism.",

To avoid confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands are ignored. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping is supported. A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them.\n\nNote that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the invocation of `git`. In particular, this is useful when used with `-c` to pass in one-time configurations or `-p` to force pagination. For example, `loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase` can be defined such that running `git loud-rebase` would be equivalent to `git -c commit.verbose=true rebase`. Also, `ps = -p status` would be a helpful alias since `git ps` would paginate the output of `git status` where the original command does not.\n\nIf the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be treated as a shell command.

Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting.\n\nLike `fsck.<msg-id>` this variable has corresponding `receive.fsck.skipList` and `fetch.fsck.skipList` variants.\n\nUnlike variables like `color.ui` and `core.editor` the `receive.fsck.skipList` and `fetch.fsck.skipList` variables will not fall back on the `fsck.skipList` configuration if they aren’t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same values.\n\nOlder versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation is used instead, so there’s now no reason to pre-sort the list.",

This field must match exactly between the config key and the URL.\n    \n2.  Host/domain name (e.g., `example.com` in `https://example.com/`). This field must match between the config key and the URL. It is possible to specify a `*` as part of the host name to match all subdomains at this level. `https://*.example.com/` for example would match `https://foo.example.com/`, but not `https://foo.bar.example.com/`.\n    \n3.  Port number (e.g., `8080` in `http://example.com:8080/`). This field must match exactly between the config key and the URL. Omitted port numbers are automatically converted to the correct default for the scheme before matching.\n    \n4.  Path (e.g., `repo.git` in `https://example.com/repo.git`). The path field of the config key must match the path field of the URL either exactly or as a prefix of slash-delimited path elements. This means a config key with path `foo/` matches URL path `foo/bar`. A prefix can only match on a slash (`/`) boundary. Longer matches take precedence (so a config key with path `foo/bar` is a better match to URL path `foo/bar` than a config key with just path `foo/`).\n    \n5.  User name (e.g., `user` in `https://user@example.com/repo.git`). If the config key has a user name it must match the user name in the URL exactly. If the config key does not have a user name, that config key will match a URL with any user name (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user name.\n    \n\nThe list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that matches a config key’s path is preferred to one that matches its user name. For example, if the URL is `https://user@example.com/foo/bar` a config key match of `https://example.com/foo` will be preferred over a config key match of `https://user@example.com`.\n\nAll URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will match properly. Environment variable settings always override any matches. The URLs that are matched against are those given directly to Git commands.

By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and this config setting allows users to specify exceptions, e.g. for intentionally shared repositories (see the `--shared` option in [git-init\\[1\\]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)).\n\nThis is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one directory via `git config --add`. To reset the list of safe directories (e.g. to override any such directories specified in the system config), add a `safe.directory` entry with an empty value.\n\nThis config setting is only respected when specified in a system or global config, not when it is specified in a repository config, via the command line option `-c safe.directory=<path>`, or in environment variables.\n\nThe value of this setting is interpolated, i.e. `~/<path>` expands to a path relative to the home directory and `%(prefix)/<path>` expands to a path relative to Git’s (runtime) prefix.\n\nTo completely opt-out of this security check, set `safe.directory` to the string `*`. This will allow all repositories to be treated as if their directory was listed in the `safe.directory` list. If `safe.directory=*` is set in system config and you want to re-enable this protection, then initialize your list with an empty value before listing the repositories that you deem safe.\n\nAs explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by yourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by default. When Git is running as _root_ in a non Windows platform that provides sudo, however, git checks the SUDO\\_UID environment variable that sudo creates and will allow access to the uid recorded as its value in addition to the id from _root_. This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during installation \"make && sudo make install\". A git process running under _sudo_ runs as _root_ but the _sudo_ command exports the environment variable to record which id the original user has. If that is not what you would prefer and want git to only trust repositories that are owned by root instead, then you can remove the `SUDO_UID` variable from root’s environment before invoking git.",

On the fetch side, malformed objects will instead be left unreferenced in the repository.\n\nDue to the non-quarantine nature of the `fetch.fsckObjects` implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object store clean like `receive.fsckObjects` can.\n\nAs objects are unpacked they’re written to the object store, so there can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even though the \"fetch\" failed, only to have a subsequent \"fetch\" succeed because only new incoming objects are checked, not those that have already been written to the object store. That difference in behavior should not be relied upon. In the future, such objects may be quarantined for \"fetch\" as well.\n\nFor now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the quarantine environment if they’d like the same protection as \"push\".
